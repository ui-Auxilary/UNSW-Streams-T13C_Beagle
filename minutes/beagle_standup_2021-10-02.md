## Standup details

We began by talking about how we have not reached our goal of passing 100% of the tests.

### Standups

**Key question**:
-  What are we working on today?

### Road to 100%
**Dhruv**
Working on understanding what is preventing us from getting 100%, Dhruv is working on looking through each test, making sure that everything is black box tested instead of whitebox. He is also checking that each function is providing the correct returns, and also receiving the correct parameters. He is also checking if the functions are working as intended. 

**Sam**
Sam is working on correcting some mistakes in the doc.strings file, including whitespacing issues and other issues such as styling. She is also going to transfer the information from the file to the individual functions themselves.

**Christian**
Attempting to attain the 100% goal by manually testing every function to ensure accuracy. 

**Sarah**
Pair programming with Sam, also working on fixing doc.strings file.

**Lawrence**
Wrote doc.strings with some help from Sarah. Wrote it in a separate file which will be transferred into individual functions. Will also be working on writting more extensive test cases.
