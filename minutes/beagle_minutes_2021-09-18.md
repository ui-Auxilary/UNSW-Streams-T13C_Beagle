[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Date: - *18/09/21*
Participants: All members
Duration: 1 hour

### Objectives

- Prompt members to watch introductory videos
-- Discuss outline of the project_backend
- Testing
-- How to merge and make branch requests etc...
- Task delegation

## Meeting details

### Introductory Videos
[Intro to the project #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iARiNetEZV8)
[Intro to the project #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nlrxuYTdIc)
- The introductory videos were essential in helping us understand the project outline, and how
to effectively delicate tasks to members (ie. grouping similar tasks) to efficate the process
of parallel completition of tasks

**We highlighted a few key points in regards to maximizing marks:**
> Create a new branch.

> Write tests for that feature and commit them to the branch. These will fail as you have not yet implemented the feature.

> Implement that feature.

> Make any changes to the tests such that they pass with the given implementation. You should not have to do a lot here. If you find that you are, you're not spending enough time on your tests.

> Consider any assumptions you made in the previous steps and add them to assumptions.md.

### Testing

Dhruv emphasised the importance of testing before committing. As a group we made sure everyone was on the same page and had an idea of how to put forth a merge request.
- We discussed before any commit, we would show either Dhruv or someone more knowledgeable in git

**Highlighted point**
> We want to see evidence that you wrote your tests before writing the implementation. As noted above, the commits containing your initial tests should appear before your implementation for every feature branch. If we don't see this evidence, we will assume you did not write your tests first and your mark will be reduced.

## Task Delegation

To delegate tasks, we made use of the board in GitLab

The tasks were delegated as follows:
- Sarah will do auth_login_1 and auth_register_v1
- Dhruv will do channels_details_v1 and channel_messages_v1
- Christian will do channel_list_v1 and channels_listall_v1
- Samantha will do channel_invite_v1 and channel_messages_v1
- Lawrence will do channels_create_v1

Members can decide to assign themselves to any given task if needed, to account for the starting level discrepancies and assist each other when necessary. To ensure the project progresses smoothly, the deadline for each task was **Wednesday 22nd September**.

## Reflection

The first meeting minutes went smoothly, with all team members present and punctual. Going through the project outline gave a good understanding of what was required from each member, as well as how to schedule and plan each subsequent meeting (ie. setting deadlines). Getting acquainted with each other, facilitates discussion on the project and each other's strengths and/or weaknesses for task delegation.
