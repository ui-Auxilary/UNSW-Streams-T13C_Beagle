## Meeting details

### Feedback from Iteration 1
In our tute earlier in the day, we received some feedback regarding the first iteration:
- Code clarity and style is goiod
- Missed a test case in auth_login
-- Did not account for a case where a person attempted to login twice
- Fixtures
-- Some fixtures could have been broken down even further, and then be put together again
-- Should create a common file for fixtures
- Assumptions
-- Some assumptions were not valid

## Approaching Iteration 2
All of our team members took time to read through the second iteration. 

### Equal Distribution of Work
After the first iteration, everyone felt like we were more eager to take on more work whilst maintaining an equal distribution of workload. 

## Task Delegation
### Strict Due Dates
We found that in our previous iteration, we could have improved completing tasks by setting strict due dates, which we will start doing in this iteration.
