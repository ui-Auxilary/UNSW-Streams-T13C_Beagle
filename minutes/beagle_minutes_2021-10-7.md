## Watching Lectures
At the start of the meeting, we wanted to start with the project. However, we needed to write tests first and none of us had watched the lecture regarding testing, since it had not even come out yet. Nevertheless, Christian managed to find an old Hayden video about the exact same topic. So we all spent some time to finish watching these videos.

### Learning how to Test HTTP
We watched the video and learnt about json, routing, payloads and dumping. Cool stuff.
